# LogPMDatasetGenerator

Use this code to generate the dataset used in LogPMDataset paper. The software should be compiled using the rustc compiler. Furthermore, the log datasets and regex directories should be presented as environment variables "LOG_DATASETS" and "REGEX_DIRECTORY". Logging could also be controlled by environment variables mentioned in the env_log crate.
